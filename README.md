### yo 👋 

i'm Dan Yoo, swe @ here rn (>ᴗ•) ! 

I like making things for the big guys and the little guys. Stuff that impacts millions or your local neighborhood. 
I'm leaning more into front-end development these days, first on mobile, now on web. 

I love learning. Maybe to my own detriment. I try to ship much more to counteract that 🚢
