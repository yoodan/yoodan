### yo 👋 

i'm dan yoo, swe @ here rn (>ᴗ•) ! 

I like making things for the big guys and the little guys. Stuff that impacts millions or your local neighborhood. 

I lean more into front-end development, first on mobile, now on web. But I've also done some back-end on AWS and wrote wrappers to integrate with back-end systems.
One might say, _full-stack_.

I love learning. Maybe to my own detriment. I try to ship much more to counteract that 🚢
