## Hello there! 👋

i was previously a software dev at amazon doing back-end and mobile development in kotlin and java ☕️

now i'm at a super mysterious company doing full-stack web dev 🤖

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- html / css
- javascript
- typescript
- react
- node
- how to make better espresso

⚡ Fun fact:
i can't think of any
